<h1>The Family Flyer</h1>

<p>This project is authored by Claire Helland, Jacqueline De Guzman, and Racquel Tung.  We programmed an HTML email newsletter to encourage families, especially those with younger children, to travel together.</p>

<p>After our image header, our first feature was our destination of the moment:  Paris, France.  The button routes the user to an external article about the City of Lights.</p>

<p>This section is followed by 3 areas of content:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Highlighted social media accounts of traveling families</li>
  <li>Hopeful parent hacks for flying with young children</li>
  <li>Helpful tips from the Pla family on how to turn credit card points into a discounted (or free) vacation</li>
</ul>

<p>We have embedded links to real social media accounts and external web articles.</p>

<p>It was a challenging, yet rewarding pleasure to prepare this for our Cohort-mates!  As we are all new to this, we look forward to and appreciate your input on how to improve our skills for future projects.
